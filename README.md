# Voodoo Token Faucet

The Voodoo Token faucet is a decentralized application that allows anyone to claim free Voodoo Tokens (VDO) on the PulseChain blockchain. This faucet is designed to boost adoption, lower entry barriers, and introduce new users to the Voodoo ecosystem, where claimed tokens can be used for staking, gambling, and more.

## Overview

The Voodoo Token Faucet is a decentralized, user-friendly platform that distributes free Voodooo Tokens to users. By simply connecting a PulseChain-compatible wallet (such as MetaMask), anyone can claim a free Voodoo Token. These tokens can then be used across the Voodoo ecosystem, including staking platforms and gambling applications, giving new users a risk-free way to participate and explore.

## Key Features of the Faucet

- **Free VDO Token Claim:** Instantly claim 1 free Voodoo Token to your wallet.
- **Decentralized & Secure and Transparent:** Every claim is visible through the smart contract.
- **Fast & Cheap:** The claiming process is extremely cheap.
- **Open Source:** Faucet smart contract code is publicly available for review and verification.

## How It Works

1. **User connects a PulseChain-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the faucet.**
2. **User clicks the ‘Claim’ button.**
3. **A transaction is sent to the smart contract, which verifies eligibility and transfers 1 VDO token to the user’s wallet.**
4. **User can immediately use the token in other Voodoo DApps, such as staking or gambling.**
